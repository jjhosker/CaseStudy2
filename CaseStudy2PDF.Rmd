# Introduction
This report answers 5 critical questions asked in Case Study 2 for MSDS 6306-402 (Thursday, 6:30 - 8:00 PM).

>    First, we will create and print out Matrix X in R, Python and SAS.  Second, we will calculate and plot the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) volatility decayed over 10, 30 and 100 days.  Third, we will calculate the mean and median circumference of five different trees; plot a scatterplot of trunk circumference vs. the age of the tree; and plot a boxplot of the tree type versus its circumferences.  Fourth, we will look at the maximum and minimum monthly average temperature over a period of years by Country ("TEMP.csv") and by City ("Citytemp.csv"") and compare them.   We will examine the average monthly and yearly temperatures for the United States (US), converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  In addition, we will look at the average temperature difference between years.  Finally, we will plot using polar coordinates.  

# Folder Description

The URL with the code and our analysis is on the GitHub website:  [\textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/jjhosker/CaseStudy2}](https://github.com/jjhosker/CaseStudy2.git).  It contains the following important files:

>1.  README:  This file provides instructions on how to run the R code and provides information in detail of each of the files in the GitHub repository.

>2.  RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R:  This file can be found in the Analysis sub-directory under the CaseStudy2 GitHub repository.   It is the main R makefile with the function calls. 

>3.  Makefile_GatherData.R:  This file can be found in the Analysis/Data sub-directory under CaseStudy2 GitHub repository.  This R makefile installs all required R-libraries and then loads the R-libraries.  Second, this R makefile uploads the TEMP.csv and CityTemp.csv data files with monthly average temperature data by country and by city, respectively.  This makefile also creates the raw data, and creates the cleaned datasets.   In cleaning the data, we read in the csv files; we remove NAs and blanks in the data; and we reformat the date data.  This makefile then saves all these datasets to the Analysis/Data sub-directory.

>4.  RFunctions_CaseStudy2.R:  This file can be found in the Analysis sub-directory under the CaseStudy2 GitHub repository.   This file contains functions that are loaded and used the main R makefile(RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R). 

>5.  In addition to the two raw data sets, there are three data files created below and three PNG files which are loaded into the PDF file on creation.   In addition, we provide a text file (SessionsInfo.txt) containing all the R session information including the current R version and all the libraries and packages being utilized.  All the files below can be found in the Analysis/Data sub-directory under this GitHub repository.
>     - Raw:  TEMP.csv
>     - Raw:  CityTemp.csv
>     - Cleaned:  TEMPclean.csv
>     - Cleaned:  CityTempclean.csv
>     - R version:  SessionInfo.txt
>     - PNG:  SAS_MatrixCode.PNG
>     - PNG:  SAS_MatrixOutput.PNG
>     - PNG:  Python_Matrix.PNG

>6.  Finally, the CaseStudy2PDF.Rmd file runs the main RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R and extracts code to generate this "CaseStudy2PDF.pdf"" report.   This report uses code that that is extracted from the main RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R and then run.
>     - To use this Rmd file to create a PDF, the user has to install MikTex (the non-basic version).  The URL with instructions to install MikTex is [\textcolor{blue}{MikText Install website}](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex).

# Running the R-Code

Before beginning please review the README.md file in GitHub website [\textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/jjhosker/CaseStudy2}](https://github.com/jjhosker/CaseStudy2).  In short, download and clone the GitHub repository and the sub-directories.  RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R should be executed in the Analysis sub-directory of this GitHub repository; and CaseStudy2PDF.Rmd can be executed from this GitHub repository.  

>1.  In the Analysis sub-directory in this repository, execute the main R source code RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R, which performs the analysis for this report. 
>     - The RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R loads function in the RFunctions_CaseStudy2.R and executes the makefile Makefile_GatherData.R in the Analysis/Data directory.  Makefile_GatherData.R installs the packages, loads the libraries and cleans the raw data.  A message indicating that the libraries loaded may appear after executing the R code that follows.  
>     - If a failure occurs, please check the function "packagelibrary.check" in the Makefile_GatherData.R and/or the SessionInfo.txt file, both found in the Analysis/Data sub-directory of the CaseStudy2 GitHub repository.

>2. To generate this PDF report, execute CaseStudy2PDF.Rmd in this GitHub repository.  Please note the required installations of software to generate the PDF is detailed in the prior section, Folder Description.

###     Q#4.iv: Compare the two graphs in (4.i) and (4.iii) and comment on it below:

>   1. We notice that cities in China (e.g. Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Taiyuan, Peking, Tianjin and others) are in the top 20 cities with the largest monthly average temperature difference in Celsius between the maximum and minimum from 1900 to 2013 but China as a country is not in the to 20 countries with the largest monthly difference between the maximum and minimum temperature.  However, nearby countries like Mongolia are.

>   2. We notice that the cities of Montreal and Toronto in Canada are in the top 20 cities with the largest difference in monthly average temperature and Canada is one of the top 20 countries with the largest monthly difference between the maximum and minimum temperature.  

>   3. We notice that the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg in Russia are in the top 20 cities with the largest difference in monthly average temperature and Russia is one of the top 20 countries with the largest monthly difference between the maximum and minimum temperature.  In addition countries nearby such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Estonia, Ukraine and other are on the top countries with the largest monthly difference between the maximum and minimum temperature.   

>   4. We notice that the cities of New York and Chicago in the Unites States are in the top 20 cities with the largest difference in monthly average temperature but overall the United States is not in the top 20 countries with the largest monthly difference between the maximum and minimum temperature.  

## Question #5: Semester Bonus Question

> We Run the R-code below and print out the graph.  For more details in R, see R-code section for Question #5 in RMakefile_CaseStudy2.R.

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Conclusions:

> In this report, we answer five questions/tasks and have provided five answers.  

>    1. We created and printed out Matrix X in R, Python and SAS.

>    2. We downloaded the daily stock prices for Automatic Data Processing (ADP) from Yahoo finance and plotted it.  We then calculated and plotted the ADP volatility decayed over 10, 30 and 100 days.

>    3. We analyzed the native "Orange"" data set and calculated the mean and median circumference of five different trees; plotted a scatterplot of trunk circumference vs. the age of the tree; and plotted a boxplot of the tree type versus its circumferences.

>    4. We uploaded the "TEMP.csv" and "CityTemp.csv"" data set and found the difference in the maximum and minimum monthly average temperature over a period of years by Country ("TEMP.csv") and buy City ("Citytemp.csv"").   In addition, we compared the two outputs by City versus Country.   Moreover, we selected a subset of average monthly temperatures for the United States (US); converted them from Celsius to Fahrenheit; calculated the average yearly temperature; and calculated the difference in maximum and minimum temperatures by year. 

>    5. Finally, we plotted a graph with x and y polar coordinates.
